# Useful Python Scripts

Welcome to my personal collection of Python scripts! This repository acts as a library for tools and utilities that I use frequently. 

As I write more scripts, I will add them here to build up a reusable codebase.

## 📂 Project Structure

To keep things organized and easy to find, **scripts are sorted into folders based on their category**.

Currently available:
* **`Image_Processing/`** - Tools for manipulating images (e.g., converting formats).

*(Future categories like `Automation` or `Data_Analysis` will be added as new scripts are created.)*

## 📜 Current Scripts

### 1. PNG to SVG Converter (Multi-color)
Located in: `Image_Processing/`

A script that converts PNG images into SVG vectors while preserving multiple colors.
* **Input:** PNG file
* **Output:** SVG file with color layers preserved.
